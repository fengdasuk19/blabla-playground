Chen Zhuang, Hailing from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Wen-Ling Chao graduated from the Chiao Tung University, with a degree in Humanities and Social Sciences. Wen-Ling’s ancestry traces back to the Shandong province of Mainland China, from which her grandparents departed for Taiwan in 1949. Wen-Ling’s inherent interest in the social identity of Taiwan and the Mainland, both on a personal and societal level, propelled her to become an exchange student at Fudan University in 2014. Her preoccupation with social issues has not been limited to the academic world. As the chief executive of the Educational Support Group for Poor Rural Children and co-founder of the Social Enterprise Thinking Club in her college, she led more than 50 students in various social service initiatives to benefit disadvantaged children and farmers in Taiwan. Wen-Ling has also hosted many activities, such as the Forum for Post 90s, where nearly 200 students from Mainland China developed a better understanding of Taiwan’s socio-politics. To her, peaceful Cross-Strait exchanges have begun, and the communication cannot stop. To continually deepen mutual understanding between the younger generations of Taiwan and the Mainland is of vital importance. She has promoted this proposition on various platforms, the value of which was recognized in the Taiwan Best Policy Open Tournament, where her proposal emerged as one of the finalists. Inspired by her time as an intern at the office of the ex-municipal chairman of the Kaohsiung City Council, Wen-Ling plans to explore at the Yenching Academy issues concerning the Asia-Pacific, specifically Cross-Strait Relations.
