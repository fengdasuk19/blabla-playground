Rebecca Arcesati, from Italy, graduated in Language Mediation and Intercultural Communication at Milan State University, focusing her undergraduate studies on Chinese language and culture. Following her research interests in Chinese politics and international relations, especially in Central Asia, she is now pursuing a Master’s degree in International Science, China and Global Studies, at the University of Turin.  She spent half a year in China to improve her language skills at Beijing Language and Culture University and Liaoning Normal University. As a language mediator in Italy, she has been active in helping Chinese citizens integrate into the local community. Last year she interned at the Asia Pacific Financial Council, a financial organization based in Shanghai. Besides foreign policy and political philosophy, she is passionate about journalism; on the blog Spazio Economia she manages the China Analysis column, where she publishes articles and interviews about Chinese economic and social transformations, published also in major Italian newspapers. At the Yenching Academy she has chosen the Politics and International Relations concentration; her aim is to improve her understanding of China’s role in international affairs, its vision and the philosophy that inspires its diplomacy and foreign policy today. With this perspective, domestic reforms and social changes, as well as the re-emergence of Confucian ethics, will be also part of her research.
