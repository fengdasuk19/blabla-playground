Hailing from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Wen-Ling Chao graduated from the Chiao Tung University, with a degree in Humanities and Social Sciences. Wen-Ling’s ancestry traces back to the Shandong province of Mainland China, from which her grandparents departed for Taiwan in 1949. Wen-Ling’s inherent interest in the social identity of Taiwan and the Mainland, both on a personal and societal level, propelled her to become an exchange student at Fudan University in 2014. Her preoccupation with social issues has not been limited to the academic world. As the chief executive of the Educational Support Group for Poor Rural Children and co-founder of the Social Enterprise Thinking Club in her college, she led more than 50 students in various social service initiatives to benefit disadvantaged children and farmers in Taiwan. Wen-Ling has also hosted many activities, such as the Forum for Post 90s, where nearly 200 students from Mainland China developed a better understanding of Taiwan’s socio-politics. To her, peaceful Cross-Strait exchanges have begun, and the communication cannot stop. To continually deepen mutual understanding between the younger generations of Taiwan and the Mainland is of vital importance. She has promoted this proposition on various platforms, the value of which was recognized in the Taiwan Best Policy Open Tournament, where her proposal emerged as one of the finalists. Inspired by her time as an intern at the office of the ex-municipal chairman of the Kaohsiung City Council, Wen-Ling plans to explore at the Yenching Academy issues concerning the Asia-Pacific, specifically Cross-Strait Relations.

Coline Deltreil Lacoste was born in France and is currently living in Bordeaux.From September 2013 to June 2015, she studied at Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris 16, specializing in economics. She graduated with first class honours and is currently studying European Economics and Policy at the University of Bordeaux Montesquieu. While economics is Coline’s cup of tea, art is her passion. As a sculptor’s daughter, she has always lived in an artistically-enlightened environment. Since childhood, she has developed a keen interest in the arts and a resilient creative streak. She has never considered visiting museums or attending previews, theatre plays and concerts as a drudgery, but rather as a hobby. Her ideal career is to hold a managerial position in an international art rental network, thus understanding and appreciating the stakes of the cultural sector. Coline has developed a keen interest in China since her godfather, who is a French photographer specializing in China and Myanmar, taught her about the Middle Kingdom. She is able to speak a little Chinese, having been taught by a Peking University alumnus who strengthened her love for China and admiration for his alma mater. Joining the Yenching Academy of Peking University in September 2016 is thus an honor and an opportunity to renew her passion for China.
